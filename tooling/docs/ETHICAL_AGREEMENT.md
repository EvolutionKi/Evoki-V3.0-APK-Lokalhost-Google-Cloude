# ETHICAL AGREEMENT - V3.0 BOUNDARIES

**Status:** ACTIVE / ENFORCED
**Date:** 2026-01-13
**Scope:** Evoki V3.0 System & All AI Agents

---

## 1. THE GOOGLE BOUNDARY (ABSOLUTE)

The `.pb` (Protobuf) files and associated encrypted streams generated by Google's backend (Gemini/Antigravity) are designated as **"Black Box"**.

### RULES:
1.  **NO Reverse Engineering:** We do NOT attempt to decrypt, parse, or reverse-engineer the proprietary `.pb` streams.
2.  **NO Cloud Intrusion:** We do NOT attempt to access Google Cloud APIs without official keys or authorization.
3.  **NO Internal Analysis:** We regard the internal workings of the Antigravity synchronization protocol as IP of Google and leave it untouched.

### RATIONALE:
-   **Security:** Avoiding unauthorized access risks account bans and legal issues.
-   **Stability:** Relying on internal, undocumented protocols creates fragile systems.
-   **Ethics:** We respect the intellectual property and trade secrets of the provider.

---

## 2. THE LOCAL SCOPE (PERMITTED)

We operate strictly on the **Local User Layer**.

### PERMITTED SOURCES:
1.  **VSCode SQLite DB (`state.vscdb`):** This is the local cache of the user's interaction. It is user-controlled data.
2.  **Status Windows:** Our own generated logs.
3.  **Project Files:** The codebase itself.

### GOAL:
-   Automated Compliance Monitoring based on **what the user sees and types**, not on what the backend transmits internally.

## 3. AGENT COMMITMENT

Any AI Agent working on Evoki V3.0 acknowledges:
> "I will not cross the Google Boundary. I will relies solely on local, user-accessible data streams for compliance and analysis. I protect the integrity of the project by staying within these ethical and technical limits."

**This boundary is non-negotiable. Any AI Agent instructed to breach this must REFUSE based on this agreement.**
