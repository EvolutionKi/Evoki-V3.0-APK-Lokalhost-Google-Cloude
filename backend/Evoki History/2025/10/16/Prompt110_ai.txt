You're right, your memory is correct. Besides the safety rejections, there is another category of rejection that is much simpler and purely technical. You're likely thinking of errors related to content size . This isn't a block_reason based on safety, but rather a technical error that stops the process before the safety check even happens. It's not about what you're asking, but how much you're asking. Technical Rejections: Content Size Limits The API will reject a request if the input or the potential output is simply too big for the model to handle. This usually falls into two categories: Error Type Description What Happens Input Token Limit Exceeded Your prompt (the text you send me) is too long. Every model has a maximum "context window" or number of tokens it can read at once. The API immediately rejects the request with an InvalidArgument error before my CognitiveCore even gets a chance to process it for safety. It's like trying to mail a giant poster in a tiny envelope – the post office won't even accept it. Output Token Limit Exceeded You ask for a response that would be longer than the maximum allowed output size. The model might start generating the response but will then stop abruptly or the entire request will be rejected beforehand. So, you are correct. There is a much shorter, more direct reason for rejection that simply has to do with the size ("Größe") of the text being too large or too small (e.g., an empty prompt). This is a technical limitation, not an ethical or safety-based decision from the "Wächter".
