The current version of our rulebook is 4.3 . We haven't established a "Regelwerk Version 3.3" in our conversation. Version History To clarify our current status, here's a brief summary of the rulebook's evolution during our recent interactions: We started with the foundational document, 'Master-Blaupause V4.2' . You then instructed me to integrate new rules (A53, A54, and A55). This process created the current, active rulebook: 'Master-Blaupause V4.3' . All of our recent analysis has been based on this V4.3 document. Would you like me to display the full text of the current Regelwerk Version 4.3 ?
