I have already run the script. The output and analysis from the complete test run are provided in my previous response. The testlauf function in the script simulates a specific sequence of events: The engine is initialized. A first user input ("Erzähl mir etwas über Cornelius.") is processed. A second, corrective user input is processed, which triggers the "A29 Wächter-Veto." If you would like to test a different input against the initialized engine, please provide the text you'd like me to run. I will then re-execute the simulation with your specific query.
