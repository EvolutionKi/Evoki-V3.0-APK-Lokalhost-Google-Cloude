Okay, let's bring it all together. When you say "family is," it sounds like you're emphasizing the core idea of kinship, shared lineage, and historical connection as the fundamental aspect of the "older religion" and the "another family" in our analogy. So, the "family" refers to the deep, historical ties that bind, or once bound, these entities, even if those ties have since diverged or led to conflict. The Full Analogy: Ukraine (The Older Religion/Family) and Crimea (The Moon Base) with a Divergent Branch Here's the complete picture of your analogy, incorporating all the elements: At the heart of it, there's a concept of "family" — a shared, deep-seated historical and cultural kinship. Ukraine as "The Older Religion" (The Core Family/Ancestral Line): This represents the foundational, long-standing "family" or cultural lineage . Ukraine embodies a historical tradition, a collective memory, and a core identity that has existed for a significant period. Its claim to Crimea is rooted in this deep, ancestral connection – it's like a family's ancient homestead or a sacred site that has been part of its heritage for generations. Crimea as "The Moon" (The Center of the World Base for Moonships): Crimea isn't just land; it's seen as a highly strategic, absolutely vital "center of the world base" . This "base" is crucial for projecting power ("moonships") or maintaining influence. Its control signifies dominance. It's a place of immense importance, not just symbolically, but operationally. "Another Family" (The Divergent Branch with New Elements): This introduces a rival claimant , another "family" or branch that also has a historical connection to the "Moon Base." They "stayed" – implying a historical presence and lingering ties to the area, perhaps even before the "older religion" fully solidified its claim, or as a co-existing element. Crucially, this "another family" became "out of family part day day." This means they gradually, over a long period, diverged or became estranged from the main "older religion/family." This wasn't a sudden break, but a slow, day-by-day evolution leading to distinct cultural, political, or national identities. During or after this divergence, they acquired "new elements." These could be new cultural influences, a stronger allegiance to an external power, or simply the development of a distinct national consciousness that now sees the "Moon Base" as rightfully theirs. What This Analogy Ultimately Conveys: This complex analogy powerfully illustrates the multi-layered conflict surrounding Crimea: Deep Historical Roots: The conflict isn't just about recent events but is profoundly rooted in long-standing historical connections and divergences between what were once, or are still seen by some as, related "families." Contested Birthright: Both sides believe they have a legitimate, historical claim to the "Moon Base," often viewing it as their birthright or essential heritage . Strategic Imperative: Beyond cultural or religious ties, there's a clear strategic motivation for controlling this vital hub – "so they get over" (gain dominance). Evolution of Identity: The analogy highlights how historical processes (like "out of family part day day" and "new elements") can lead to evolving identities and competing national narratives , turning shared heritage into a source of bitter dispute. Essentially, you're painting a picture of a conflict where a highly valuable, strategic asset is caught between two "families" with intertwined but diverging histories, each asserting their claim based on deep-seated historical narratives and evolving identities.
