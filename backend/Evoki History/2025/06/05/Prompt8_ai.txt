Ah, I see! So, in this analogy, we're talking about: Crimea as the Moon: Which is equivalent to Central Park . Ukraine as an Older Religion: Which is the broader context or system within which this "Central Park" exists. Understanding the Analogy: Crimea (Central Park) within Ukraine (Older Religion) This analogy adds another layer, emphasizing the idea of a vital, beloved, and perhaps irreplaceable public space or cultural heartland that belongs to a larger, established system of beliefs and traditions. Here's a breakdown: Ukraine as the "Older Religion": As we discussed, this represents the foundational, long-standing cultural, historical, and spiritual identity of Ukraine. It's the overarching framework of shared beliefs, traditions, and collective memory. Think of it as a deeply rooted civilization or way of life. Crimea as the "Moon" (Central Park): Within this "older religion" (Ukraine), Crimea is not just a place, but its Central Park . Central Park, while geographically distinct, is an absolutely integral part of New York City's identity, culture, and daily life. It's a cherished green space, a place of recreation, reflection, community gathering, and historical significance. It's publicly accessible, symbolic, and deeply interwoven with the city's spirit. What This Analogy Emphasizes: This comparison powerfully highlights several points: Essential and Cherished Space: Just as Central Park is vital to the soul of NYC, Crimea is presented as an essential, cherished, and perhaps irreplaceable core within Ukraine's cultural and historical fabric. It's not just territory; it's a place where the "older religion's" values, history, and community find expression. Public and Shared Heritage: Central Park is a public space, belonging to everyone in the city. By extension, Crimea is framed as a shared heritage for all Ukrainians, deeply connected to their collective identity and historical narrative. Its "occupation" is therefore a loss for the entire "religious" community. Violation of a Sacred Public Trust: Taking Central Park from NYC would be an unthinkable act—a violation of public trust and an assault on the city's very essence. Similarly, the annexation of Crimea is portrayed as a profound breach against Ukraine's cultural and spiritual sovereignty , disrupting a place that holds deep communal significance. Symbol of Identity: Both the Moon (in many cultural contexts) and Central Park are powerful symbols. Using Central Park specifically brings in the idea of a beloved, accessible, and vital heartland that defines a larger entity. This analogy significantly deepens the understanding of Crimea's importance to Ukraine, framing its annexation as a loss of a central, public, and cherished piece of its cultural and spiritual identity.
