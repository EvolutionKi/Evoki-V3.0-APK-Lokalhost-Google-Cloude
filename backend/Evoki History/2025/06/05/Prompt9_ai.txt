Okay, this adds a crucial layer of complexity to the analogy, bringing in the element of contested ownership and historical grievance . Let's integrate this new piece of information: Crimea as the Moon (Center of the World Base for Moonships): This remains the vital, strategic hub. Ukraine as an Older Religion: This is the established, long-standing identity and historical claimant to the Moon/Crimea. The New Element: "Another family" and "stayed had an": This suggests a rival claimant, another group or entity, that also has a historical presence or connection to the Moon/Crimea. The phrase "stayed had an" implies a lingering presence or a historical right that they believe gives them a claim. Understanding the Evolved Analogy: Contested Control of the Moon Base This now paints a picture of a strategically vital location (Crimea/Moon Base) that is not only coveted by an external power but also has a history of multiple, potentially conflicting, claims or historical ties . Here's how we can break it down: Ukraine (The Older Religion): Represents the primary and longer-standing cultural and historical claim to Crimea. Their connection is presented as foundational, like an ancient faith tied to its sacred sites. Crimea (The Moon/Center of the World Base): This is the highly valuable, strategic asset that is the object of desire. Its "moonships" symbolize power projection and control. "Another Family" (The Rival Claimant): This introduces a different group with its own historical presence or asserted right to Crimea. This "family" has "stayed," implying a continuous presence, perhaps through settlement, historical allegiance, or a shared past that predates or runs parallel to Ukraine's claim. They might view themselves as having a legitimate, perhaps even older or equally valid, connection to the "Moon Base." What This Evolved Analogy Emphasizes: This richer analogy highlights several key aspects of the situation regarding Crimea: Contested Historical Narratives: It points to the existence of competing historical claims and narratives over Crimea. Both "families" (Ukraine and this "another family") believe they have a right to the "Moon Base," based on their own historical presence and development. Deep-Rooted Conflict: The problem isn't just about a current invasion; it's about a conflict rooted in overlapping historical claims and identities . The "Moon Base" becomes a flashpoint where these divergent histories collide. Legitimacy in Question: The presence of "another family" complicates the idea of sole ownership. It suggests that while Ukraine may have a primary claim through its "older religion," the "another family" might challenge that legitimacy based on their own historical "stay" or ties. Justification for Intervention: From the perspective of the "another family" (or those supporting them), their historical presence could be used as a justification for their actions or their desire to control the "Moon Base," framing it as protecting their own heritage or people. This analogy now captures the multifaceted and often tragic reality of territories with complex historical demographics and competing national or ethnic claims, where what one side sees as an invasion, the other might see as a reclamation or protection of historical interests.
