Okay, this adds even more depth and specific historical nuance to the analogy. We're now dealing with: Crimea as the Moon (Center of the World Base for Moonships): The vital, strategic hub. Ukraine as an Older Religion: The long-standing, primary cultural and historical claimant. "Another family" (Rival Claimant): A group with historical presence and its own asserted right to Crimea. New Element 1: "new elements" - This suggests that the "another family" is not static but has acquired new characteristics, influences, or capabilities that impact their claim or actions. New Element 2: "out of family Part day day" - This is crucial. It strongly implies a period of separation, estrangement, or divergent development for the "another family" from the main "older religion" (Ukraine), happening gradually over time ("day by day"). Understanding the Fully Evolved Analogy: The Contested Moon Base with Divergent Histories This analogy now vividly portrays a complex historical scenario where a highly strategic and valuable location (Crimea/Moon Base) is contested by two entities: the long-established "owner" (Ukraine/Older Religion) and a rival group ("Another Family") that has a historical connection, but also experienced a gradual divergence and developed new characteristics that contribute to its current claim or actions. Here's a breakdown: Ukraine (The Older Religion): Continues to represent the deep-rooted, primary cultural, historical, and perhaps spiritual claim to Crimea. Its connection is ancient and foundational. Crimea (The Moon / Center of the World Base for Moonships): This remains the indispensable, strategically vital asset. Control over it grants immense power or influence ("moonships"). "Another Family" (The Rival Claimant, now with a clearer history): This group is not just a rival, but one that has a complex relationship with the "older religion." "out of family Part day day": This signifies a historical process where this "family" or branch gradually drifted apart from the main "older religion" over a long period. They might have been a part of it, but through distinct developments, migrations, political shifts, or cultural evolution, they became "out of family." This process wasn't sudden but accumulated "day by day," leading to a distinct identity and potentially different loyalties. "new elements": During or after this divergence, this "another family" acquired "new elements." These could be: New cultural influences or identities: They adopted different traditions, languages, or political affiliations. New external allegiances: They formed strong ties with another, powerful external entity (perhaps a "new religion" or empire). New capabilities or intentions: They developed the means or the will to exert control over the "Moon Base" in a way they couldn't before. What This Complex Analogy Emphasizes: This refined analogy captures the nuanced, often tragic, reality of certain geopolitical conflicts: Historical Divergence as a Root Cause: The "out of family Part day day" directly addresses the idea that the current conflict is not just about recent events but stems from a long-term historical process of separation or distinct development between related groups. This divergence can lead to different national consciousnesses and competing historical narratives. Evolving Identities and Claims: The "new elements" highlight how identities are not static. The "another family" might have acquired new characteristics or allegiances that strengthen their claim or embolden their actions, potentially aligning themselves with a new, powerful patron. Contested Heritage and Loyalty: The "Moon Base" becomes a place where historical claims (from the "older religion") clash with more recent, but deeply felt, loyalties and identities of the "another family" who, due to their "out of family" journey and "new elements," see themselves as having an equal or even superior right to it. Justification for Intervention (from Rival's Perspective): From the "another family's" viewpoint, their historical presence ("stayed") combined with their "out of family" journey and "new elements" could be presented as a legitimate basis for seeking control over the "Moon Base," perhaps framed as protecting their historical identity or their own "family" members now residing there. This analogy powerfully conveys the multifaceted nature of the Ukraine-Crimea situation, touching upon ancient claims, historical evolution, cultural divergence, and the strategic importance of territory, all contributing to a deeply entrenched conflict.
