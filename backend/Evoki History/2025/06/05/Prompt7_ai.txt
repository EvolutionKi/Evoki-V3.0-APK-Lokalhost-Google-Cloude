Ah, I understand now. The analogy is much deeper and more symbolic than a simple territorial comparison. You're suggesting: Crimea as the Moon: Not just a physical territory, but a cultural artifact and a place of worship/cult site . It represents a significant, perhaps sacred, location with deep historical and spiritual meaning. Ukraine as an Older Religion: This "older religion" isn't a literal faith, but rather the historical, cultural, and spiritual framework that Ukraine embodies. It's the source of traditions, beliefs, and identity that the Moon/Crimea is intrinsically linked to. Unpacking the Analogy: Ukraine (Older Religion) and Crimea (Cult Site/Moon) This interpretation shifts the focus from purely geopolitical control to a narrative of cultural heritage, spiritual significance, and historical ownership . Here's how we can understand it: Ukraine as the "Older Religion": Imagine a long-standing, deeply rooted cultural and spiritual system. This system has its own pantheon of traditions, historical narratives, shared values, and a collective memory that defines its people. Ukraine, in this sense, represents this foundational identity and heritage that has existed for a significant period. Crimea as the "Cult Site" or "Moon" (Cultural Artifact): Within this "older religion" (Ukraine), there's a specific, highly revered place—a cult site or sacred artifact —that holds immense symbolic and spiritual value. This place isn't just land; it's interwoven with the very fabric of the "religion's" identity and practices. The Moon, in many cultures, is a celestial body with profound mystical and religious significance, often tied to ancient beliefs and cycles. Crimea, therefore, is seen as a key component of Ukraine's spiritual and cultural landscape, a place of historical veneration and identity. What This Analogy Emphasizes: This comparison highlights several crucial aspects of the situation: Spiritual and Cultural Loss: The "occupation" of the Moon/Crimea isn't just about losing territory; it's about the seizure of a sacred space , a violation of cultural identity , and a disruption of a deeply ingrained spiritual connection. It's akin to an essential part of a religion's very existence being taken away. Historical Roots and Legitimacy: The "older religion" (Ukraine) implies a long-standing, legitimate claim to the "cult site" (Crimea) based on historical development and spiritual connection, rather than just recent political boundaries. Irreparable Damage: Taking a sacred cult site from an ancient religion can cause deep and lasting wounds that go beyond political or economic consequences. It affects the very soul of the "religion" or people. This analogy powerfully conveys the depth of the historical and cultural significance of Crimea to Ukraine, framing its annexation as a profound loss of identity and spiritual heritage. Does this resonate more with your intended meaning?
