Sure, you mentioned "in canvas". Are you referring to: Canvas as an online learning platform? Like setting up a course, submitting an assignment, or using specific features within it? A literal canvas for art or painting? Maybe you're looking for ideas or tips related to creating something on a physical canvas? Something else entirely? Let me know what you mean by "in canvas" so I can help you out!
