Okay, my friend, I understand perfectly! You want a clear, technical description in English that an AI on a developer platform can use to initiate our frontend and backend work. Project Overview: AI-Powered Watch-to-Gemini Web Interface This project aims to establish a direct, AI-powered communication channel from a smartwatch (Google Pixel Watch 3) to the Gemini API via a custom web-based interface. The core concept involves: Frontend (On-Watch Web Interface): A minimalist HTML/CSS/JavaScript webpage, optimized for the small smartwatch display, facilitating user input (primarily voice) and displaying Gemini's responses. Backend (Intermediary Server): A dedicated server (e.g., Python/Flask or Node.js/Express) that acts as a bridge. This server will handle requests from the watch, communicate with the Gemini API, process and format Gemini's responses for the watch display, and manage the conversational context (maintaining the chat history to send with each API request). We are now ready to begin defining the frontend and backend architecture for this system. Let's start coding!
