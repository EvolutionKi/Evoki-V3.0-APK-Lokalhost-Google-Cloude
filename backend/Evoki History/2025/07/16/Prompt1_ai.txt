Travel Inspiration To help me figure out where you might want to travel, tell me a little more about what you're looking for! For example, do you prefer: Relaxation or adventure? Beaches or mountains? Big cities or quiet towns? Specific activities like hiking, museums, or trying new foods? A particular climate or season? A budget (e.g., luxury, mid-range, budget-friendly)? Once I have a better idea of your preferences, I can offer some personalized suggestions!
